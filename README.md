# Generative-Photo-Reconstruction
QMIND 2024-25

Low-Resolution GAN:

Generates low-resolution images (e.g., 28x28 MNIST digits).

Trained using a standard GAN loss.

High-Resolution SRGAN:

Takes the low-resolution images and enhances them to high-resolution.

Uses residual blocks and pixel shuffling for super-resolution.

Trained using a combination of adversarial loss and content loss.
